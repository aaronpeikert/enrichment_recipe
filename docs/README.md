# Documentation

This is the main folder of documentation aimed to help end-users remix and deploy
these workflows for their own enrichment analysis needs.

## Contents

Here you will find the step-by-step guides for different computing environments,
along with some other useful stuff.

* `README.md`: this helpful welcome file.

* `guide_for_linux_users_with_docker.md`: A step-by-step guide to getting your 
reproducible transcriptome and enrichment analysis in Docker, if you can install/run
Docker on the computer (there are many users who cannot for various reasons).

* `guide_for_linux_users_without_docker.md`: A step-by-step guide if Docker is
not available on the computer, we can use another utility called `udocker`,
which doesn't need root permissions for installation or execution.

* `guide_for_windows_users.md`: Turn a windows computer into a reproducible 
bioinformatics powerhouse.

* `glossary.md`: If you are new to bioinformatics, or if any of the terms here don't 
make sense, take a look at this glossary.
