# A guide for linux users without Docker

## Requirements

To follow along with this workflow you'll need a computer with internet access,
2 or more CPU threads, 8GB RAM and Docker installed.

Beginner level unix shell scripting is required, as is intermediate R/Rmarkdown
scripting.

You will need a GitHub username and password, as well as git installed on your
computer.

A dockerhub account is not neccessary unless you want to save the images to 
dockerhub.
That could be useful if you want to reuse these containers on multiple other
computers.

### 1. Set up the git repository

### 2. Customise the workflow

### 3. Customise the Docker image

### 4. Build the Docker image

### 5. Run the workflow

### 6. Working with containers and images
