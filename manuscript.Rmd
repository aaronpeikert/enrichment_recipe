## Introduction

Enrichment analysis is one of the most used methods in computational biology,
and involves the summarisation of omics data to reflect biological changes, such as
the detection of pathway activation in development or disease [1,2](Slonim 2002;Khatri et al, 2012). 
While enrichment analysis is undoubtedly a key method for the interpretation of large
data sets, there are concerns that inadvertant misuse of these methods leads to 
unreliable results.
These potential problems include (i) the lack of correct background for over-representation tests,
(ii) lack of p-value correction for multiple testing and (iii) lack of reporting detail
[3-6](Timmons et al, 2005; Reimand et al, 2019; Wijesooriya et al, 2022; Zhao & Rhee 2023).

Another emerging problem is that while computational research is theoretically amenable to complete
reproducibility, in reality this is rarely achieved in computation-intensive research due to lack
of detail provided in methods sections, lack of shared data and lack of code [7](Peng 2011).

The lack of reproducibility is particularly acute for enrichment analyses, as web-based and
point-and-click tools appear to be far more popular than computer script based methods 
[5](Wijesooriya et al, 2022).
Web-based tools are a particular concern, as it is known that algorithms and functional annotation
sets undergo regular updates, but the versions are not regularly reported nor captured, 
making later replication difficult if not impossible [5](Wijesooriya et al, 2022).

A lack of reproducibility does not mean a study is invalid, however it cannot be ruled out that
mistakes have been made in the enrichment analysis and that the results are biased or false.
As omics data are becoming more routine in the drug development process and are used to
inform clinical practice, reproducibility should become a minimum requirement for 
bioinformatics analysis of omics data.


Although it doesn't need to be this way due to the precise nature of modern computers and software.
In order for bioinformatics analysis to be 100% reproducible requires a few key elements.
These are:

* Input data

* Set of instructions (analysis code).

* Operating system

With these things working together, it is possible for a data analysis workflow to be 100%
replicable and auditable for many years into the future.

To achieve this requires some planning:

1. Input data needs to be deposited to a public and persistent location.

2. Analysis code packaged in a working Docker container.

A Docker container is a minimal operating system that has the necessary software to complete a task.
Docker is used extensively in web development, to rapidly set up many modular services into
full stacks of functionality.
For example using Docker containers, a website front end and back end can be set up once, and then
deployed at huge scale (eg thousands of instances) with minimal work involved.

In addition, Docker containers ensure consistent behaviour across different types of computing
infrastructure, so it doesn't matter whether the container is run on a linux workstation,
desktop windows PC or cloud server, the end results should be identical.

While there have been many general guides to computatonal reproducibility in the literature,
there is a need for boilerplate code templates that researchers can quickly adapt/tweak for their own
projects.

The demand for this is expected to be huge, as there are massive numbers of published articles featuring
such analyses.
Just in 2022, there were 9,917 PubMed articles with the keywords pathway/enrichment/ontology analysis
in the title or abstract alone.

The more rigourous, well documented and reproducible these studies are, we will find less wasted
research resources and greater trust/support from the general community.
