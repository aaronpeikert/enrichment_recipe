Reproducibility is essential to the scientific enterprise by confirming the validity of new discoveries
[1](National Academies of Sciences 2019, p1).
According to a 2016 survey of *Nature* readers, 52% of respondents agreed that there was "significant
crisis" of reproducibility [2](Baker 2016).
While bioinformatics and other branches of computational research are theoretically amenable to
complete reproducibility, in reality this is rarely achieved due to lack of detail provided in methods
sections, lack of shared data and lack of code [3](Peng 2011).
Indeed even if data and code are shared, reproducibility still cannot be guaranteed due to the
differences in computing environments over time, and the availability of dependancies [4](Perkel 2020).

To address this, many articles have been written to endorse the use of "virtual machines" or
"containerisation" to encapsulate the "environment" including the operating system and dependancies
along with the research code to facilitate a high degree of reproducibility [4-16](Perkel 2020;
Stein 2010; Dudley & Butte 2010; Sandve et al, 2013; Piccolo & Frampton 2016; Grüning et al, 2014;
Lewis et al, 2016; da Veiga Leprevost et al, 2017; Kulkarni et al, 2018; Pasquier et al, 2018;
Hung et al, 2019; Brito et al, 2020; Piccolo et al, 2021).
Containers also allow for an easy installation process, as all working dependencies are shipped together
and can be installed with a single command.

In addition to shared code, data and containerisation, there are a few ways researchers can make their
work more reproducible.
Firstly, thorough documentation makes the reproducibility process a great deal easier and more accessible
to novice bioinformaticians.
Literate programming using Rmarkdown or Jupyter notebooks provides optimal documentation by embedding
free text explanations together with the code and outputs such as charts and tables.
Secondly, code and data can be linked. This means that the code knows the location of the the data,
avoiding any "file not found" errors.
Lastly, reanalysis can be made as simple as possible by creating a master script that executes analysis
for each figure sequentially, making the entire manuscript reproducible by executing just one command.
Taken together, computational reproducibility is a spectrum (**Figure 1**).
Currently, bioinformatics work at the gold standard is rare, despite the availability of such tools for
over a decade.

![Figure 1: The computational research reproducibility spectrum. Creator: Altuna Akalin.](img/repro.webp "The computational research reproducibility spectrum.")

In this article, we focus on enrichment analysis, which is one of the most used methods in
computational biology, and involves the summarisation of omics data to reflect biological changes,
such as the detection of pathway activation in development or disease
[17,18](Slonim 2002; Khatri et al, 2012).
While enrichment analysis is undoubtedly a key method for the interpretation of large
data sets, there are concerns that inadvertant misuse of these methods leads to
unreliable results.
These potential problems include (i) the lack of correct background for over-representation tests,
(ii) lack of p-value correction for multiple testing and (iii) lack of reporting detail
[19-22](Timmons et al, 2005; Reimand et al, 2019; Wijesooriya et al, 2022; Zhao & Rhee 2023).
Without comprehensive methodological documentation and reproducibility, it isn't possible to verify
the validity of the methods and results.
We are concerned about the reliability of published enrichment analyses, as web-based and
point-and-click tools appear to be far more popular than computer script based methods for this type
of work [21](Wijesooriya et al, 2022).
Web-based tools are a potential concern, firstly because sometimes methods, options and parameters
are not completely described, and secondly, algorithms and functional annotation sets undergo
regular updates.
These historical versions are typically not archived, which hampers later reproducibility.
In some cases the entire web resource can become unavailable, and hence irreproducible due to
a phenomenon known as link decay [23](Hennessey & Ge 2013).

A small number of enrichment analysis applications have been developed to have beneficial properties
of being "containerised" and with archived historical versions [24,25](Ge et al, 2020;
Perampalam & Dick 2020).
This helps reproducibility greatly, but is not a complete solution as it lacks information about how
the input data was used and a record of any parameter selections.

Therefore the most complete reproducibility solution is to use containerisation to provide a scripted
workflow with prescribed links to research data, external databases and complete record of parameter
selection.
Designed correctly, these containers could encapsulate bioinformatics workflows and ensure their
computational reproducibility for decades to come with just one or a few simple commands.
There are multiple barriers to entry for such workflows including (i) the added difficulty compared to
existing point-and-click solutions; (ii) time poorness of researchers to learn new skills; and (iii)
a lack of step-by-step guides and templates aimed at beginner users.

We address this firstly by providing working templates for docker image and Rmarkdown scripts for
common transcriptome and enrichment analysis routines.
Secondly, we provide step-by-step written and video guides to help users customise these templates for
their own work, deploy the analysis, verify the results, and archive the Docker image.

But is this extra work really necessary?
Although our previous work suggests that enrichment analyses generally lack sufficient methodological
detail [5](Wijesooriya et al, 2022), we don't have empirical evidence confirming irreproducibility.
Therefore before recommending or prescribing Docker-based bioinformatics workflows, it is necessary
to assess directly whether current practices are appropriate, by trying to reproduce the enrichment
analyses of previously published studies, and examining whether the conclusions of those articles
are supported or not.
In the following section we investigate the computational reproducibility of enrichment analyses
shown in a sample of 20 journal articles published in 2019.
This should provide a sound basis for recommendations.

## A systematic assessment of reproducibility in enrichment analysis

### Methods

<Anusuiya to populate>
<references to start at [101](Author Year)>
<Wanted to check how this looks in the file>

From a list of 186 PubMed central articles using enrichment analysis that we examined previously
[5](Wijesooriya et al, 2022), we selected 20 articles that fulfilled the following criteria; (1) the
organism under study is human; (2) the tool used was DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization,
and Integrated Discovery)[101](Huang et al, 2007); (3) the omics type was gene expression (array or
RNA-seq); and (4) that the gene list was provided in the supplementary data.

The lists of genes were collected from the supplementary files and stored in a spreadsheet, paying
special attention to preventing gene name errors from occurring[102](Zeeberg et al, 2004).
The reproducibility analysis was performed using the respective methodologies stated in the methods
sections of the 20 articles with DAVID version 6.8 (March-May 2022).

Briefly, we used the DAVID "Analysis Wizard" and pasted in the provided gene list into the text box,
selecting this as "gene list", together with the appropriate gene identifier type.
Typically this was the official gene symbol.
The species was specified as *Homo sapiens*.
Next we clicked on the "Functional Annotation Tool" link, bringing up the "Annotation Summary Results”
page.
We followed the steps indicated in the respective papers to select appropriate gene sets investigated
in the articles such as gene ontology (biological process, molecular function), KEGG pathways, etc.
Next, the "Functional Annotation Chart" was clicked on, opening a new window with a table of
enrichment results, which were saved for future reference.

Firstly, the data presented in the paper was compared with the results we obtained, recording any
discrepancies.
Secondly, the statements made in the abstract, results, and discussion sections were carefully examined
and cross-checked with our results to understand whether those assertions survive reproduction or not.

Each article was critically evaluated and given a score of one (1) to three (3).
Articles rated 1 showed overall poor reproducibility.
For example most GO and/or KEGG terms mentioned in the results and discussion were not confirmed
upon reproduction, and the conclusions of the study were overall not supported.
Articles were rated 2 when at least 50% of the terms are observed as significant after replication,
according to the original study's significance threshold, and most conclusions were supported.
Articles were rated 3 when they showed a high level of reproducibility, with 80% or more of the terms
shown in the article observed again in reproduction, and all conclusions were supported in reproduction.
Results are summarised in table and bar chart form.

It is important to note that the DAVID 6.8 server has been replaced by DAVID 2022 server, starting
from June 1, 2022.
For our analysis, DAVID version 6.8 was used for replication procedures.
It was ensured that our analyses got completed by 31 May 2022.
It is no longer possible to reproduce analyses conducted in DAVID 6.8



## A container based approach to addressing reproducibility of enrichment analysis

### Implementation

Infographic:

* source control

* containerisation

* literate programming

* documentation

The templates provided include the Dockerfile and an Rmarkdown-based workflow script.
These templates are intended to be altered by the end user, but here is an overview of the contents of
each.

The Dockerfile uses a base image from Bioconductor which should correspond to the latest available
stable release version (currently 3.16), running on R v4.2.2 and Ubuntu 22.04.
The image contains instruction for installing a few useful utilities including `nano` and `git` for
modifying scripts, and `magic-wormhole` for transfering data between computers.
It installs R packages from CRAN and Bioconductor repositories to fulfill common tasks in transcriptome
analysis such as fetching RNA-seq counts from DEE2 with `getDEE2` [201](Ziemann et al, 2019),
differential expression with `DESeq2` [202](Love & Huber, 2014),
enrichment analysis with `clusterprofiler`, `fgsea` and `mitch`
[203-205](Yu et al, 2012; Korotkevich et al, 2016; Kaspi & Ziemann 2020).
It also contains instructions to clone a github repository, which contains the scripts that run the
analytical workflow.
Lastly, it copies a gene set library from Reactome [206](Gillespie et al, 2022) with a clear version
history to guarantee provenance of the annotation data.

The `example_workflow.Rmd` is the Rmarkdown based script that undertakes the enrichment analysis.
Rmarkdown allows the unification of extended descriptions, code and results into a single document,
which is becoming ubiquitous in bioinformatics and data science more generally
[207](Grolemund & Wickham 2017, p423).
The ability to provide extended descriptions is helpful for providing contextualising information about
the purpose of the work, detailed methods and interpretations derived from the analysis.
The Rmarkdown script contains code chunks that perform specific tasks including fetching an example
data set from DEE2, inspecting data quality, differential expression and two types of enrichment
analysis; over-representation analysis (ORA) and functional class scoring (FCS) (**Figure XX**).
For each enrichment analysis conducted, a checklist is provided to comply with reporting guidelines
[22](Zhao & Rhee 2023).

### Findings

To demonstrate the utility of this workflow, we present the results of an example data analysis;
it is a comparison of control and 5-azacitidine-treated AML3 cell transcriptomes with RNA-seq
in triplicate [208] (Lund et al, 2014).

We use this analysis to try to understand better the effect of DNA methylatransferase inhibitors on
genome regulation and elaborate upon previous findings by Lund et al (2014), which mainly focused on
the relationship between RNA expression and DNA methylation, but did not show results of a
transcriptome-only enrichment analysis.
Furthermore, we provide a comparison of the two most common approaches for enrichment analysis; ORA and
FCS, and give guidance for interpreting results of such tests.

After fetching the data from DEE2, the number of reads per sample was confirmed to be in the range of
11-16M.
Genes with fewer than 10 reads per sample on average were removed from the analysis, leaving 13,168
genes.
Differential expression analysis revealed 3,598 differentially expressed genes with FDR<0.05, with
1,672 exhibiting higher expression and 1,926 exhibiting lower expression in 5-azacytidine treated cells
(Figure XXA).
These differentially expressed gene sets were subjected to ORA analysis separately, using the list of
13,168 genes as the background, and gene sets from REACTOME.

With ORA, we observed 149 upregulated and 48 downregulated gene sets.
We prioritised the enrichment analysis by enrichment score, a pseudo measure for effect size,
which tends to highlight smaller and more specific gene sets undergoing more drastic differential
expression, rather than large gene sets that undergo very small expression changes.
This led to the identification of upregulated pathways related to nuclear RNA export,
glucokinase regulation and G1/S DNA replication pathways; while downregulated pathways
were associated with interferon signaling, interleukin signaling, granulopoiesis and NADPH oxidase
(host defence) (Figure XXB).

After FCS, we identified 241 upregulated genesets and 155 downregulated genesets.
FCS upregulated pathways were associated with prometaphase chromosome condensation, nuclear RNA export
and defective homologous recombination repair (Figure XXC).
Downregulated pathways related to endosomal/lysosome pathway, interferon signaling and TLR/TNF signaling.

Regarding upregulated pathways, the similarity between ORA and FCS was relatively high, exhibiting a
Jaccard index of 0.54, however these method disagreed in downregulated pathways, with a Jaccard
index of only 0.27 (Figure XXD).

## Concluding remarks

While there have been many general guides to computatonal reproducibility in the literature,
there is a need for boilerplate code templates that researchers can quickly adapt/tweak for their own
projects.

The demand for this is expected to be huge, as there are massive numbers of published articles featuring
such analyses.
Just in 2022, there were 9,917 PubMed articles with the keywords pathway/enrichment/ontology analysis
in the title or abstract alone.

The more rigourous, well documented and reproducible these studies are, we will find less wasted
research resources and greater trust/support from the general community.
